# Scripts

* **numba_interp.py**: Python code for bilinear interpolation, necessary for the implementation of the semi-lagrangian algorithm, used for considering advection terms in PDEs.
* **logistic_SL.py**: Python code for solving a single-species advection-reaction-diffusion equation with a logistic reaction via finite differences with a fourth order runge-kutta for reaction and diffusion and a semi-lagrangian integration scheme for advection.
* **spatial_public_good_comp.py**: Python code for hybrid Gillespie simulation of the two-strain model with non-local competition and spatial PG game, and movement due to diffusion and advection by a point-vortex flow.
